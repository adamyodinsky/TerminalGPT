## Why?

Some advantages of using TerminalGPT:

- TerminalGPT's answers are tailored to your machine's operating system, distribution, and chip-set architecture.
- Doesn't use your conversation data for training the model.
- Your conversations are stored locally on your machine, so only you can access them.
- Efficient context management for super cheap api usage.
- It's highly available and can be used whenever you need it.
- You can use TerminalGPT with your IDE terminal, which means you won't have to constantly switch between your browser and your IDE when you have questions.
- Fast, reliable, lightweight.
- Quick one shot question mode.
