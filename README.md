# Installation

1. Install the package with pip install.

```sh
pip install terminalgpt -U
```

2. (Optional) Inject the token to the executable script on your local machine so you don't have to export it every time you open a new terminal. (replace `<YOUR_OPENAI_KEY>`  with your OpenAI API key).

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_KEY>
git clone https://github.com/adamyodinsky/TerminalGPT.git
cd TerminalGPT
./inject_token.sh
